# CSV File Information

Each row represents a sample, which in this case is a participant
watching a video. Each participant watched five videos, so each
participant has five rows associated with it.

  - [`location`](#identification-location-pid-and-order): Locations of
    the study. Lab 1 and Lab2 are the rooms of our lab and Museum is our
    booth at The Tech Interactive in San Jose.
  - [`pid`](#identification-location-pid-and-order): The IDs of the
    participants. They are unique per location not across locations.
  - [`video`](#video): The video the participants watched.
  - [`order`](#identification-location-pid-and-order): The order of the
    video from the participantâ€™s perspective.
  - [`age`](#age): The age of the participant. (19-/19-25/26-45/45+)
  - [`gender`](#gender): The gender of the participant.
    (Female/Male/Other)
  - [`race`](#race): The race of the participant.
  - [`experience`](#experience): Whether the participant had prior VR
    experience.
  - [`arousal`](#arousal): The arousal level the participant reported
    after watching the video.
  - [`presence`](#presence): The presence level the participant reported
    after watching the video.
  - [`sickness`](#sickness): The simulator sickess level the participant
    reported after watching the video.
  - [`preference`](#preference): The preference level the participant
    reported after watching the video.
  - [`exploration`](#exploration): The proportion of a full 360-degree
    horizontal sweep participant made watching the video

The first ten results are show
below.

Each variable is shown descriptively and explored further below.

## Identification (Location, PID, and Order)

Note that the unique identifier for a participant is the pair of
variables (location,
pid).

``` r
# When grouping by PID only, how many PIDs have more than 5 rows associated with them?
psych_360 %>% 
  group_by(pid) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n != 5) %>%
  nrow
```

    ## [1] 59

``` r
# Instead, it's better to group by PID and Location if you want participants to be uniquely grouped
psych_360 %>%
  group_by(pid, location) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n != 5) %>%
  nrow()
```
